QuickFind.Net
=============

This is a .NET re-write of a tool I wrote many years ago in VB6 and placed on ArcScripts.  
http://arcscripts.esri.com/details.asp?dbid=14236

It allows you to quickly filter the current contents view in ArcCatalog.   The filter is based just a string 'contains' function.  Regex support could be added at some point but not everyone is comfortable with the syntax.

Currently it is built for ArcGIS Desktop 10.1 as am AddIn but I'll do 10.2 soon (as I think there were some changes to the addin model).
